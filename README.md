# NEWS:
Cosmos completely backstabbed me

He completely took away any traces of my contributions on cosmic (95% of the repo) and claimed all the work was done by him.

Whatever you do, do NOT star the repo that my pinned cosmic fork is forked from. 

The forked repo in my pins is the official repo, if you had starred the old one, undo it.

Do NOT support the original repo!


DO NOT HARASS COSMOS

This is not meant to start a witchhunt.

Spread this news around everywhere you can by copying this image and putting it in places where cosmic is mentioned.
