# NEWS:

Whatever you do, do NOT star the repo that my pinned cosmic fork is forked from. 

Cosmos has completely removed all forms of credit to me, and my contribution access.

The forked repo in this link is the official repo, if you had starred the old one, undo it.

Do NOT support the original repo!

Cosmos backstabbed me after all my work on Cosmic, and thats just a shitty thing to do.

DO NOT HARASS COSMOS

This is not meant to start a witchhunt.
